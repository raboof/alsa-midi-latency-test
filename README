== Intro ==

alsa-midi-latency-test measures the roundtrip time of a MIDI message in the
alsa subsystem of the linux kernel using a high precision timer. It
calculates the worst case roundtrip time of all sent MIDI messages and
displays a histogram of the rountrip time jitter.

== Compiling, installing and running ==

The following libraries are required to build alsa-midi-latency-test:

 * debhelper (>= 5)
 * autotools-dev
 * automake
 * libasound2-dev (>= 1.0.13)

Compile and install alsa-midi-latency-test as follows:

 $ sh autogen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

Run alsa-midi-latency-test as follows:

 $ alsa-midi-latency-test -l

   Lists available MIDI input and output ports.

 $ alsa-midi-latency-test -i [input port] -o [output port]

   This runs the benchmark with the given input and output port. Note, that the
   input and output ports have to be connected using a MIDI cable in the real
   hardware to loop the MIDI message back.

 $ man alsa-midi-latency-test

   The man page contains documentation for all available command line switches.

== Results ==

Results of some benchmarks created with alsa-midi-latency-test can be found
in the benchmarks/ sub-directory. The setup of the MIDI-chains of the results
